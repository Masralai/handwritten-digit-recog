# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNNs

## Overview
This project is a **Handwritten Digit Recognition** system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras**. It is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing digits from user input.

## Features
- Trained on the MNIST dataset.
- Uses CNNs for high accuracy.
- Supports real-time digit recognition from images.
- Interactive UI (if applicable) for testing.
- Can be extended for custom datasets.

## Model Architecture
- **Conv2D** layers for feature extraction
- **MaxPooling2D** for dimensionality reduction
- **Flatten** to convert 2D features into a 1D array
- **Dense (Fully Connected Layers)** for classification
- **Softmax Activation** for output prediction

## Results
- Training Accuracy: **~99%**
- Test Accuracy: **~98%**
